# AudioRecognition
DESCRIPTION

This is a personal project to practice the concepts in machine learning and signal processing that I am learning this semester

GOALS

To create a simple neural network classifier which can distinguish between a few voice commands such as "Stop" and "Go"
Once this is created and tested, it will be implemented on an arduino and used to control a small electric car

PROGRESS

2/21 - I have decided to use simple sounds at first and develop a classifier for these sounds. The sounds chosen are a "snap" and a "clap". I have analyzed the FFT waveform produced by both of these sounds and can see a clear distinction, which will hopefully allow me to create a relatively accurate classifier with simple concepts in neural networks. I am meeting with a professor this week to discuss this project and recieve input as to how to proceed. All of the work so far has been done in matlab; after creating a successful classifier, I will rewrite the code in C.
